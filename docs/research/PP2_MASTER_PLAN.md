# PP2 Master Plan: Berry Grading and Export Price Forecasting

Last updated: 2026-08-27

This plan is designed for the four-day Progress Presentation 2 constraint. It focuses on academically defensible progress, not model proliferation.

## PP2 Strategy

The PP2 goal is to show:

- the project has been recovered and audited;
- V1 artifacts are understood as historical baselines;
- V2 datasets are prepared correctly;
- berry grading avoids sample leakage;
- forecasting uses a defensible target;
- at least one fresh baseline experiment exists for each subproblem;
- software integration can be demonstrated through the existing backend/mobile flow.

Do not train many models for PP2. The required comparison is intentionally small:

Berry:

- Existing V1 MobileNetV2 as historical baseline.
- V2 MobileNetV2 using sample-level train/validation/test split.
- One limited improvement experiment if time permits.

Forecasting:

- Naive persistence baseline.
- RandomForest with lag/rolling features.
- One limited improvement experiment if time permits.

## Phase 0 — Repository and Research Audit

Status: COMPLETE

### Objective

- `data/raw/berry_images/grade_2/sample_*/`
- `data/raw/berry_images/grade_3/sample_*/`
- `data/raw/market_prices/dea_farmgate_weekly_prices_2016_2026.csv`
- Existing V1 scripts as references.

### Expected Outputs

- `data/annotations/grading_forecast/berry_grading_labels_v2.csv`
- `data/processed/grading_forecast/berry_dataset_v2_summary.json`
- `data/processed/grading_forecast/berry_split_v2/`
- `data/processed/grading_forecast/berry_split_v2_manifest.csv`
- `data/processed/grading_forecast/price_v2/cleaned_price_data_v2.csv`
- `data/processed/grading_forecast/price_v2/national_grade1_average_weekly.csv`
- `data/processed/grading_forecast/price_v2/price_v2_coverage_summary.json`

### Files/Scripts Likely To Be Involved

- `scripts/generate_grading_labels.py`
- `ml/grading_forecast/berry_grading/preprocessing/validate_dataset.py`
- `ml/grading_forecast/berry_grading/preprocessing/prepare_training_images.py`
- New likely script: `ml/grading_forecast/berry_grading/preprocessing/create_sample_level_split.py`
- `ml/grading_forecast/price_forecasting/data/clean_price_data.py`
- `ml/grading_forecast/price_forecasting/data/prepare_forecast_training_data.py`
- `ml/grading_forecast/price_forecasting/data/create_forecast_split.py`

### Validation Criteria

- V2 berry manifest row count matches raw readable image count.
- Every manifest path exists.
- No duplicate image paths.
- All three classes are represented.
- Every split contains all three classes.
- No sample_id appears in more than one split.
- Price target has exactly one row per observed date.
- Missing weeks are documented, not silently fabricated.
- Grade 2 sparse coverage is documented.

### Completion Criteria

- V2 dataset summaries and split files exist.
- V1 artifacts remain untouched.
- `PP2_RESULTS.md` is updated with dataset evidence.
- `EXPERIMENT_LOG.md` has a dataset version entry.

Completion result:

- Berry V2 manifest contains 671 readable images from the current raw folder structure.
- Berry split is deterministic with seed 42 and uses `grade + sample_id` groups.
- Berry split validation passed with zero sample groups crossing train, validation, and test.
- Price V2 cleaned dataset contains 7,742 preserved observations.
- Primary target contains 232 National Grade 1 average farm-gate weekly observations.
- Chronological forecast split was created without shuffling or future leakage.

### Risks

- Existing scripts may overwrite V1 filenames by default.
- Some image paths may be missing from old labels.
- Weekly dates may not align to a fixed weekday.
- Grade 2 history is too sparse for reliable forecasting.

### Fallback/Contingency

- Add V2-specific output paths instead of overwriting old outputs.
- Use current folder structure as label source.
- Use observed weekly sequence and gap reporting rather than forcing a rigid calendar grid.
- Keep Grade 2 as limitation/future work.

### Estimated Priority

CRITICAL. Completed.

### Script Safety Note

The older V1 scripts were inspected before Phase 1 execution. Several still default to V1 output paths. Do not run them for V2 without checking command arguments:

- `scripts/generate_grading_labels.py` can overwrite `data/annotations/grading_forecast/berry_grading_labels.csv`.
- `ml/grading_forecast/berry_grading/preprocessing/prepare_training_images.py` can write into `data/processed/grading_forecast/berry_images_processed`.
- The original price-processing scripts can overwrite `cleaned_price_data.csv`, `forecast_training_data.csv`, `train_forecast_data.csv`, or `test_forecast_data.csv`.

For V2 dataset work, use:

- `ml/grading_forecast/berry_grading/preprocessing/prepare_berry_dataset_v2.py`
- `ml/grading_forecast/price_forecasting/data/prepare_price_v2_dataset.py`

Forecasting selected improvement:

- Add extended historical lag features: `lag_4`, `lag_8`, and `lag_12`.

### Expected Inputs

- Phase 2 and Phase 3 baseline outputs.

### Expected Outputs

- Completed berry dropout experiment entry.
- Completed forecast extended-lag experiment entry.
- Updated baseline vs improvement comparison tables.

- No test-set tuning.
- If performance worsens, result is still recorded.

### Completion Criteria

- `EXPERIMENT_LOG.md` and `PP2_RESULTS.md` contain baseline vs improvement comparisons.

Completion result:

- Berry improvement: MobileNetV2 dropout changed from 0.25 to 0.35 and evaluated on the same untouched V2 test split.
- Berry Phase 4 metrics: accuracy 0.8073, macro F1 0.8068, weighted F1 0.8076, Grade 2 precision/recall/F1 0.7805 / 0.8889 / 0.8312.
- Berry conclusion: dropout 0.35 did not improve or worsen the saved headline test metrics compared with the Phase 2 V2 baseline.
- Forecasting improvement: RandomForest extended with `lag_4`, `lag_8`, and `lag_12`.
- Forecast Phase 4 RandomForest MAE/RMSE/MAPE/R2: 78.1641 / 84.8622 / 3.9482 / -0.3566.
- Forecast conclusion: extended lags improved over the Phase 3 RandomForest baseline, but did not beat Naive Persistence.
- Berry artifacts: `ml/grading_forecast/berry_grading/models/v2_phase4/` and `ml/grading_forecast/berry_grading/evaluation/_outputs/v2_phase4/`.
