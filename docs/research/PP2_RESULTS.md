## Dataset Evidence From Audit

### Berry Dataset

Raw dataset path: `data/raw/berry_images/`

| Item | Audit Result |
| --- | --- |
| Total raw image files | 671 |
| Grade 1 images | 224 |
| Grade 2 images | 224 |
| Grade 3 images | 223 |
| Sample folders per grade | 56 |
| Root-level images | 0 |
| Unreadable images | 0 |
| Duplicate content groups | 0 |
| Main image dimensions | 4000x3000 and 4080x3060 |
| EXIF camera models | SM-A127F, Galaxy A06 |
| Known issue | Some samples have 3 or 5 images instead of 4 |

Interpretation:

The berry dataset is suitable for a meaningful PP2 classification experiment if it is split at physical-sample level. The current folder structure supports deriving `grade` and `sample_id` automatically. Manual annotation of unavailable metadata is not required for PP2.

### Berry V2 Sample-Level Split

Artifacts:

- `data/processed/grading_forecast/berry_split_v2/`
- `data/processed/grading_forecast/berry_split_v2_manifest.csv`

Split seed: 42.

| Validation | 24 | 95 |
| Test | 27 | 109 |

Sample counts by grade:

| Split | Grade 1 | Grade 2 | Grade 3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Train | 39 | 39 | 39 |
| Validation | 8 | 8 | 8 |

- Every split contains Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3.
- No `grade + sample_id` group appears in more than one split.
- The split is sample-level, not image-level.

### Price Dataset

Raw dataset path: `data/raw/market_prices/dea_farmgate_weekly_prices_2016_2026.csv`

| Item | Audit Result |
| --- | --- |
| Total rows | 7,742 |
| Date range | 2021-02-22 to 2026-08-18 |
| Main practical coverage | early January 2022 to 2026-08-18 |
| Commodity | black_pepper |
| Country | Sri Lanka |
| Market level | farm_gate |
| Frequency | weekly |

| Grades | Grade 1, Grade 2 |
| Grade 1 rows | 6,930 |
| Grade 2 rows | 812 |
| Duplicate date/district/grade/price_type rows | 0 |

Primary forecasting target:

`National + Grade 1 + average + farm_gate + weekly`

Reason:

This target is the most defensible PP2 forecasting series because it has stronger historical coverage than Grade 2 and avoids fabricating sparse observations.

## Historical V1 Results

### Berry V1 MobileNetV2

Source: `ml/grading_forecast/berry_grading/models/berry_classifier_metrics.json`

| Metric | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Accuracy | 0.7778 |
| Weighted precision | 0.8516 |
| Weighted recall | 0.7778 |
| Weighted F1 | 0.7447 |
| Grade 1 recall | 1.0000 |
| Grade 2 recall | 0.3333 |
| Grade 3 recall | 1.0000 |

Interpretation:

This is a useful historical baseline, but it is not final PP2 evidence because it used the old 360-image dataset and did not include a proper sample-level train/validation/test split.

### Forecast V1 RandomForest

Source: `ml/grading_forecast/price_forecasting/models/forecast_metrics.json`

| Metric | Train | Test |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| MAE | 15.7114 | 45.8347 |
| RMSE | 24.3440 | 47.7556 |
| MAPE | 0.9527 | 2.2911 |
| R2 | 0.9841 | -6.1315 |

Interpretation:

The V1 RandomForest model showed overfitting or poor future generalization. This motivates a cleaner V2 comparison against naive persistence.

| --- | ---: |
| Accuracy | 0.8073 |
| Macro precision | 0.8122 |
| Macro recall | 0.8078 |
| Macro F1 | 0.8068 |
| Weighted precision | 0.8145 |
| Weighted recall | 0.8073 |
| Weighted F1 | 0.8076 |

Per-class V2 test metrics:

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1 | Support |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Grade 1 | 0.9063 | 0.7632 | 0.8286 | 38 |
| Grade 2 | 0.7805 | 0.8889 | 0.8312 | 36 |

Confusion matrix:

```text
[[29,  3,  6],
 [ 1, 32,  3],

```

Historical comparison:

| Experiment | Dataset | Split | Accuracy | Macro F1 | Weighted F1 | Grade 2 Recall | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| V1 MobileNetV2 | berry_v1 | legacy train-val | 0.7778 | 0.7447 | 0.7447 | 0.3333 | Historical baseline |
| V2 MobileNetV2 | berry_v2 | sample-level train-val-test | 0.8073 | 0.8068 | 0.8076 | 0.8889 | Selected PP2 berry baseline |
| V2 dropout 0.35 | berry_v2 | same sample-level test split | 0.8073 | 0.8068 | 0.8076 | 0.8889 | Limited Phase 4 experiment; no metric improvement |

Interpretation:

The V2 model is the selected PP2 berry grading baseline because it was trained on the expanded V2 dataset, used the leakage-safe sample-level split, and was evaluated once on the untouched V2 test set. The V1 and V2 metrics are useful for historical comparison, but they are not directly equivalent experiments because V1 used the older 360-image dataset and did not include the same sample-level train/validation/test methodology.

## V2 Forecast Results

Status: COMPLETE.

Target:

`National + Grade 1 + average + farm_gate + weekly`

Reason for Grade 1 target:

National Grade 1 average has the strongest usable coverage for PP2. Grade 2 is preserved in the cleaned dataset but remains too sparse for the primary forecasting baseline.

Artifacts:

- `ml/grading_forecast/price_forecasting/models/v2/forecast_model.joblib`
- `ml/grading_forecast/price_forecasting/models/v2/forecast_features.json`
- `ml/grading_forecast/price_forecasting/models/v2/forecast_metrics.json`
- `ml/grading_forecast/price_forecasting/models/v2/naive_persistence_metrics.json`
- `ml/grading_forecast/price_forecasting/models/v2/forecast_model_metadata.json`

- `ml/grading_forecast/price_forecasting/evaluation/_outputs/v2/feature_importances.png`
- `ml/grading_forecast/price_forecasting/evaluation/_outputs/v2/residuals.png`

Chronological split:

| Split | Rows | Date Range |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Train | 162 | 2021-02-22 to 2025-03-18 |
| Validation | 34 | 2025-03-25 to 2025-11-25 |
| Test | 36 | 2025-12-02 to 2026-08-18 |

Test methodology:

- Naive Persistence and RandomForest were evaluated on the same 36 V2 test timestamps.
- RandomForest was trained only on `forecast_train.csv`.
- Test feature rows were built from full target context, but every feature date is before its prediction date.
- Lag and rolling features use previous available observations, not guaranteed previous calendar weeks.
- No missing weeks or prices were fabricated.

Final comparison:

| Experiment | Target | Split | MAE | RMSE | MAPE | R2 | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Naive persistence | National Grade 1 average | 36 identical test timestamps | 16.4094 | 22.5208 | 0.8539 | 0.9045 | Stronger Phase 3 baseline |
| RandomForest | National Grade 1 average | 36 identical test timestamps | 82.4179 | 88.4452 | 4.1679 | -0.4736 | Required ML baseline, did not outperform naive |
| Extended-lag RandomForest | National Grade 1 average | same 36 test timestamps | 78.1641 | 84.8622 | 3.9482 | -0.3566 | Improved over Phase 3 RF, but not over naive |

Interpretation:

Naive Persistence outperformed RandomForest on every final V2 test metric. This does not invalidate the experiment; it is the Phase 3 finding. For PP2, the defensible conclusion is that the simple persistence baseline generalizes better than the current RandomForest configuration on this short and mostly stable test period.

## Phase 4 Limited Improvement Results

Status: COMPLETE.

### Berry Limited Improvement

Selected change:

- Phase 2 baseline dropout: 0.25.
- Phase 4 dropout: 0.35.
- All other core settings remained aligned with the Phase 2 MobileNetV2 baseline.
- Evaluation used the same untouched `berry_split_v2/test` directory with 109 images.

| Model | Accuracy | Macro F1 | Weighted F1 | Grade 2 Precision | Grade 2 Recall | Grade 2 F1 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Phase 2 V2 MobileNetV2 | 0.8073 | 0.8068 | 0.8076 | 0.7805 | 0.8889 | 0.8312 |
| Phase 4 Dropout 0.35 | 0.8073 | 0.8068 | 0.8076 | 0.7805 | 0.8889 | 0.8312 |

Phase 4 per-class berry metrics:

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1 | Support |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Grade 1 | 0.9063 | 0.7632 | 0.8286 | 38 |
| Grade 2 | 0.7805 | 0.8889 | 0.8312 | 36 |
| Grade 3 | 0.7500 | 0.7714 | 0.7606 | 35 |

Berry interpretation:

The dropout 0.35 experiment did not improve or worsen the saved headline test metrics compared with the Phase 2 baseline. This is still a valid Phase 4 finding because the experiment used the same leakage-safe split and records that this limited change did not produce measurable benefit on the V2 test set.

Berry Phase 4 artifacts:

- `ml/grading_forecast/berry_grading/models/v2_phase4/berry_classifier_metrics.json`
- `ml/grading_forecast/berry_grading/models/v2_phase4/berry_model_metadata.json`
- `ml/grading_forecast/berry_grading/evaluation/_outputs/v2_phase4/confusion_matrix.png`

### Forecasting Limited Improvement

Selected change:

- Phase 3 RandomForest baseline features plus `lag_4`, `lag_8`, and `lag_12`.
- Same V2 National Grade 1 average weekly target.
- Same 36 V2 test timestamps.
- Past-only feature construction preserved.

| Model | MAE | RMSE | MAPE | R2 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Naive Persistence | 16.4094 | 22.5208 | 0.8539 | 0.9045 |
| Phase 3 RandomForest | 82.4179 | 88.4452 | 4.1679 | -0.4736 |
| Phase 4 Extended-Lag RandomForest | 78.1641 | 84.8622 | 3.9482 | -0.3566 |

Forecasting interpretation:

The Phase 4 extended-lag RandomForest improved over the Phase 3 RandomForest baseline on all four metrics. However, Naive Persistence remained substantially stronger on the same test period. Therefore, the limited forecasting improvement did not produce the best forecasting model for PP2; it shows a modest RF improvement but confirms the simple persistence baseline as the strongest current forecasting result.

## Integration Evidence

Status: COMPLETE with runtime limitations.

Evidence file:

- `docs/research/PP2_INTEGRATION_VALIDATION.md`

Backend validation:

| Endpoint | Method | HTTP Status | Runtime Result |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| `/api/v1/grading-forecast/health` | GET | 200 | Returned `status: ok` |
| `/api/v1/grading-forecast/price-forecast` | GET | 200 | Returned forecast using `demo_baseline` |
| `/api/v1/grading-forecast/grade-only` | POST multipart | 200 | Returned Grade 1 prediction and indicated real ONNX grading model use |
| `/api/v1/grading-forecast/analyze` | POST multipart | 200 | Returned grading, forecast, recommendation, and storage fields |

Sample image used:

- `data/processed/grading_forecast/berry_split_v2/test/grade_1/sample_002/20260508_152537.jpg`

Observed endpoint details:

- Health response: `{"status":"ok","component":"berry_grading_export_price_forecasting"}`.
- Price forecast response model: `demo_baseline`.
- Grade-only predicted grade: Grade 1.
- Grade-only quality score/confidence: 79.7 / 0.65.
- Analyze decision: `SELL_EXPORT`.
- Analyze storage: `saved_to_firebase: false`.

Runtime model/fallback interpretation at Phase 5 validation time:

- At Phase 5, the backend resolved berry grading ONNX from the legacy/root artifact path: `ml/grading_forecast/berry_grading/models/berry_mobilenetv2_best.onnx`.
- Phase 8 later changed the berry runtime to `BERRY-V2-MNV2`: `ml/grading_forecast/berry_grading/models/v2/berry_mobilenetv2_v2_best.onnx`.
- At Phase 5, the price forecast endpoint returned `demo_baseline`, not the Phase 3 or Phase 4 V2 forecasting models.
- Phase 9 later changed the real application forecast runtime to `naive_persistence` using `data/processed/grading_forecast/price_v2/national_grade1_average_weekly.csv`.
- Firebase was not configured; the analyze response still completed with storage fallback.

Mobile inspection:

- Flutter API service exists and calls `/api/v1/grading-forecast/analyze` and `/api/v1/grading-forecast/recommend`.
- Default backend URL is `localhost:8000` for desktop/web and `10.0.2.2:8000` for Android emulator.
- Flutter was not run during Phase 5.

### Post-PP2 Runtime Hardening

Phase 11 backend reliability validation passed for the grading-forecast API path.

Verified behavior:

- Valid grade-only request used `BERRY-V2-MNV2`.
- Valid price forecast request used `naive_persistence` and did not return `demo_baseline`.
- Valid analyze request returned V2 grading, `naive_persistence` forecast, recommendation, and optional storage.
- Missing, empty, unsupported, corrupt, and oversized image uploads returned safe HTTP errors.
- Missing V2 berry model artifacts failed explicitly without loading the legacy/root ONNX model.
- Missing or malformed forecast data returned `forecast_unavailable`.
- Unexpected grading and recommendation failures returned safe JSON errors.

Phase 11 did not modify datasets, model artifacts, Firebase configuration, Flutter code, recommendation rules, or forecasting method selection.

Validated API endpoints:

- `GET /api/v1/grading-forecast/health`
- `POST /api/v1/grading-forecast/grade-only`
- `GET /api/v1/grading-forecast/price-forecast`
- `POST /api/v1/grading-forecast/analyze`

Documented but not separately called during the Phase 5 pass:

- `POST /api/v1/grading-forecast/recommend`

Expected PP2 evidence:

- backend health response: complete;
- one grade-only response: complete;
- one full analyze response: complete;
- note showing whether real model or fallback was used: complete;
- optional Flutter screenshots: not performed.

## PP2 Result Narrative

Recommended narrative:

The V1 implementation established a working end-to-end baseline. After PP1, the datasets were expanded substantially. The PP2 work corrects the methodology by creating V2 datasets, preventing berry sample leakage, selecting a defensible price forecasting target, comparing against simple baselines, and validating integration with the shared mobile/backend architecture.

## PP2 Speaking Points

- Research problem: support black pepper farmers/export preparation with camera-based berry grading, short-term price forecasting, and a sell/wait/process recommendation flow.
- Data preparation: PP2 rebuilt the dataset foundation as V2, with 671 berry images from 168 physical samples and a sample-level split to prevent leakage.
- Price target: forecasting uses National Grade 1 average farm-gate weekly price because Grade 2 coverage is too sparse for a defensible primary target.
- Berry baseline: the V2 MobileNetV2 model achieved 0.8073 accuracy and 0.8076 weighted F1 on the untouched V2 test split.
- Berry improvement: dropout 0.35 was tested as one limited Phase 4 change and did not improve the saved test metrics.
- Forecasting baseline: Naive Persistence strongly outperformed the Phase 3 RandomForest on the same 36 test timestamps.
- Forecasting improvement: adding `lag_4`, `lag_8`, and `lag_12` improved RandomForest, but it still remained worse than Naive Persistence.
- Integration validation: FastAPI endpoints started and returned usable responses during Phase 5; later Phase 8/9 work integrated Berry V2 runtime and Naive Persistence forecast runtime.
- Limitations: camera grading is not official SLS certification; Grade 2 forecasting is out of scope; Firebase, Flutter E2E, and final integrated validation remain pending.
- Current conclusion: PP2 has defensible V2 datasets, completed baseline experiments, one limited improvement per subproblem, honest limitations, and a known backend demo path.
- Future work: clarify Firebase/persistence requirements, validate the Flutter live flow, complete cross-component integration, improve forecasting features with additional evidence, and perform broader post-PP2 model evaluation.
