# Phase 7 — Existing Implementation Audit

Status: COMPLETE

### Objective

Understand exactly how your current component works before changing anything.

### Why first?

You already tested the application and it works technically, but the runtime is using:

* legacy berry model
* `demo_baseline` forecasting

So we need to know **where those are selected and loaded**.

### Tasks

Inspect:

* FastAPI routes
* FastAPI request/response schemas
* grading service
* forecasting service
* model loading code
* inference code
* recommendation logic
* Firebase/storage code
* configuration/environment variables
* Flutter API service
* existing grading/forecast screens

Trace:

### Deliverable

Create a short implementation map:

| Area | Current implementation | Required implementation | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Berry model | At Phase 7 audit time, runtime used legacy/root ONNX: `ml/grading_forecast/berry_grading/models/berry_mobilenetv2_best.onnx` | Integrate selected V2 ONNX if required for final runtime | Completed in Phase 8 |
| Berry V2 research artifact | V2 ONNX exists separately: `ml/grading_forecast/berry_grading/models/v2/berry_mobilenetv2_v2_best.onnx` | Keep distinct from runtime until integration is intentionally performed | Verified |
| Forecast | Runtime now uses `naive_persistence` with `data/processed/grading_forecast/price_v2/national_grade1_average_weekly.csv` | Keep forecasting decision documented; validate recommendation using real outputs next | Completed in Phase 9 |
| Forecast V2 research artifacts | V2 RF and Phase 4 RF artifacts exist separately under `models/v2/` and `models/v2_phase4/` | Do not claim runtime use until wired and validated | Verified |
| Strongest research forecast | Naive Persistence is strongest on the V2 test period | Runtime selected Naive Persistence after requirement check | Completed in Phase 9 |
| Recommendation | Existing rule logic is implemented and validated with Phase 8/9 runtime outputs | Continue to backend hardening and later full E2E checks | Completed in Phase 10 |
| Storage | Firebase storage is implemented as required result-history persistence, with fail-safe behavior when credentials are unavailable | Live Firebase validation still requires configured credentials | Completed in Phase 12; live write not validated |
| API | Existing endpoints and fallback/error behavior identified | Harden only after model/runtime decisions | Completed in Phase 11 |
| Flutter | API service and relevant screens exist | End-to-end Flutter validation still pending | Pending Phase 14 |

### Validation

Phase 7 was completed as an audit-only pass. No application code, model artifacts, datasets, backend configuration, or Flutter files were changed.

This phase should be cheap and should prevent unnecessary Codex work.

---

# Phase 8 — Berry V2 Runtime Integration

Status: COMPLETE

### Objective

Make the actual application use your **selected PP2 berry model**.

Your selected model is:

```text
BERRY-V2-MNV2
```

Artifact:

```text
ml/grading_forecast/berry_grading/models/v2/
    berry_mobilenetv2_v2_best.onnx
```

### Tasks

1. Identify current legacy model-loading code.
2. Change the PP2 runtime path to V2.
3. Load the correct:

   * ONNX model
   * class names
   * metadata if required.
4. Prevent accidental use of the legacy model.
5. Preserve existing API contract unless a change is genuinely necessary.
6. Ensure inference preprocessing matches the training pipeline:

   * 224×224
   * RGB
   * MobileNetV2 preprocessing
   * correct class ordering.

### Critical validation

Use one or more known images from:

```text
berry_split_v2/test
```

and verify:

```text
Image
 ↓
Backend
 ↓
V2 ONNX
 ↓
Prediction
```

The response should identify the **V2 runtime model**, not the legacy artifact.

### Completion criteria

You can demonstrate:

> "The backend is using the PP2 V2 MobileNetV2 artifact."

### Phase 8 completion evidence

Runtime berry grading now resolves the selected PP2 model:

```text
BERRY-V2-MNV2
ml/grading_forecast/berry_grading/models/v2/berry_mobilenetv2_v2_best.onnx
```

Validation used one existing V2 test image:

```text
data/processed/grading_forecast/berry_split_v2/test/grade_1/sample_002/20260508_152537.jpg
```

Service-level runtime validation returned a valid prediction and identified `BERRY-V2-MNV2` with the V2 ONNX path in the grading explanation. The legacy/root ONNX filename is no longer selected by the berry grading service. No dataset, model artifact, forecasting code, Firebase code, Flutter code, or recommendation logic was changed during Phase 8.

---

# Phase 9 — Price Forecasting Runtime Integration

Status: COMPLETE

### Objective

Remove the `demo_baseline` runtime behavior and connect the application to your actual forecasting methodology.

This phase requires an important research/engineering decision.

Your results are:

```text
Naive Persistence
MAE = 16.4094
R² = 0.9045
```

versus:

```text
Random Forest
MAE = 82.4179
R² = -0.4736
```

and:

```text
Extended-Lag Random Forest
MAE = 78.1641
R² = -0.3566
```

Therefore **Naive Persistence is your strongest current forecasting method**.

### Recommended implementation

Use:

```text
Latest available price
        ↓
Naive Persistence
        ↓
Next-period predicted price
```

rather than forcing Random Forest into the application merely because it is a trained ML model.

However, there is one thing to check against your official project/TAF requirements:

> If the final project explicitly requires the application itself to use a trained ML forecasting model, then you may need to use the Random Forest artifact despite Naive Persistence being the stronger benchmark.

So **Phase 9 should begin by checking that requirement**, rather than making an assumption.

### Tasks

* Remove/disable `demo_baseline` for the real application path.
* Implement the selected forecasting method.
* Load the correct V2 data/artifact if applicable.
* Make forecast output deterministic and reproducible.
* Return:

  * current/latest price
  * predicted price
  * trend/direction if already part of your design
  * forecasting method/model identifier.

### Completion criteria

The API no longer returns:

```text
demo_baseline
```

for the real application flow.

It returns a genuine research-backed forecast.

### Phase 9 completion evidence

Requirement decision:

The checked project documents require short-term price forecasting using machine-learning/time-series techniques, but no inspected requirement explicitly forced the application runtime to use a trained RandomForest artifact when a validated time-series baseline performs better. Naive Persistence was selected because it is the strongest validated forecasting method on the V2 test period.

Runtime forecast configuration:

```text
Method: naive_persistence
Target data: data/processed/grading_forecast/price_v2/national_grade1_average_weekly.csv
Metrics source: ml/grading_forecast/price_forecasting/models/v2/naive_persistence_metrics.json
```

Focused service-level validation returned:

```text
model: naive_persistence
current_price_lkr_per_kg: 1886
predicted_price_lkr_per_kg: 1886
trend: stable
metrics.mae: 16.4094
metrics.rmse: 22.5208
deterministic repeat: true
```

Missing-file validation returned `model: forecast_unavailable` instead of fabricated demo values. The real application forecasting path no longer returns `demo_baseline`. No berry grading, recommendation-rule, Firebase, Flutter, dataset, training, evaluation, or model-artifact changes were made during Phase 9.

---

# Phase 10 — Recommendation & Decision Logic

Status: COMPLETE

### Objective

Ensure the final recommendation is based on **real grading + real forecasting outputs**.

Your component's actual purpose isn't just:

```text
Image → Grade
```

or:

```text
Price → Forecast
```

It is:

```text
Berry Grade
      +
Price Forecast
      ↓
Decision Support
      ↓
Sell / Wait / Process
```

### Tasks

Audit the existing recommendation logic.

Determine:

* What inputs does it use?
* Is it using the actual predicted grade?
* Is it using the actual forecast?
* Does it use fallback/demo values?
* Are thresholds hard-coded?
* Are edge cases handled?
* Are recommendation rules consistent with your project's existing requirements?

### Important

**Don't invent new recommendation rules during this phase.**

First preserve the rules already defined in your project.

If the existing rules are incomplete or ambiguous, identify that explicitly.

### Test cases

Create representative cases such as:

```text
Grade 1 + favorable price trend
Grade 1 + unfavorable price trend
Grade 2 + favorable trend
Grade 2 + unfavorable trend
Grade 3 + favorable trend
Grade 3 + unfavorable trend
```

Then verify the recommendation.

### Completion criteria

You can explain:

> "The recommendation is generated from the actual grading and forecasting outputs."

### Phase 10 completion evidence

Recommendation service:

```text
backend/app/services/grading_forecast/recommendation_service.py
```

The `analyze` route passes `grading.predicted_grade`, `grading.quality_score`, `forecast.trend`, `forecast.current_price_lkr_per_kg`, and `forecast.predicted_price_lkr_per_kg` into the existing recommendation logic.

Focused validation confirmed:

```text
BERRY-V2-MNV2 -> Grade 1 / quality score 82.3
naive_persistence -> current 1886 / predicted 1886 / stable
recommendation -> SELL_EXPORT
```

Representative rule checks passed for Grade 1/2/3 with upward and downward trends, stable trend, missing optional quality/price fields, and invalid schema values. Invalid grade values are rejected by the API schema before reaching the service. No recommendation business rules were changed during Phase 10.

---

# Phase 11 — Backend Reliability & Error Handling

Status: COMPLETE

### Objective

Make your component robust enough for real application usage.

This is separate from model accuracy.

### Handle

#### Image errors

* missing image
* invalid format
* corrupted image
* excessively large image
* unreadable image

#### Model errors

* model file missing
* model cannot load
* inference failure
* invalid class mapping

#### Forecast errors

* insufficient historical data
* malformed price data
* missing latest observation
* invalid prediction

#### API errors

* malformed request
* timeout
* internal exception
* dependency failure

### Important rule

Do **not** silently fall back to demo/heuristic behavior if the final application is supposed to show research results.

A dangerous situation is:

```text
V2 model unavailable
       ↓
silently use legacy/demo model
       ↓
user sees result
```

That makes evaluation difficult and can produce misleading research evidence.

Prefer an explicit error or clearly labeled fallback.

### Completion criteria

The backend fails **safely and transparently**.

### Phase 11 completion evidence

Backend reliability hardening was completed for the grading-forecast API path.

Files changed:

```text
backend/app/api/routes/grading_forecast.py
backend/app/services/grading_forecast/grading_service.py
```

Validated behavior:

* Valid V2 grading uses `BERRY-V2-MNV2` and does not expose an absolute model path to the client.
* Valid forecasting uses `naive_persistence` with real V2 price data and does not return `demo_baseline`.
* Valid analyze combines V2 grading, `naive_persistence` forecasting, existing recommendation rules, and optional storage.
* Missing, empty, unsupported, corrupt, and oversized image uploads return safe HTTP errors.
* Missing V2 model artifacts raise explicit grading failure and do not load the legacy/root ONNX model.
* Missing or malformed forecast data returns `forecast_unavailable` instead of fabricated prices.
* Invalid recommendation schema values return FastAPI/Pydantic validation errors.
* Unexpected grading or recommendation service failures return safe JSON errors without client-facing stack traces.

No datasets, model artifacts, Flutter code, Firebase configuration, recommendation rules, or forecasting method selection were changed during Phase 11.

---

# Phase 12 — Firebase / Persistence

Status: COMPLETE

### Objective

Decide and implement the required storage behavior.

Current state:

```text
Firebase not configured
saved_to_firebase: false
```

### First task

Determine whether Firebase storage is:

**A. Required final functionality**

or

**B. Optional supporting functionality**

If required:

1. Configure credentials securely.
2. Configure environment variables.
3. Test save operation.
4. Test retrieval if applicable.
5. Verify stored result structure.
6. Verify failures don't crash analysis.

If optional:

> Document it as optional and don't spend significant time on it before the core model/runtime integration.

### Phase 12 implementation and validation

Decision: **REQUIRED FINAL FUNCTIONALITY** for application-level result history, based on the updated Phase 12 requirement and project/proposal persistence expectation.

Evidence:

* Existing component code already used `backend/app/services/grading_forecast/result_storage_service.py` and `backend/app/db/firebase.py`.
* `docs/guidelines_with_steps.md` identifies Firebase result storage as part of the component while also saying Firebase credentials must not be required for the local demo.
* The current implementation therefore treats Firebase as required persistence functionality when credentials are configured, but non-blocking for live grading/forecast/recommendation output when credentials are absent.

Implementation:

* Each successful persisted analysis uses a generated Firestore document ID and `analysis_id`.
* Collection: `grading_forecast_results`, or `FIREBASE_RESULTS_COLLECTION` if configured.
* Persisted records include application-level metadata, image identifier, V2 grading result, `naive_persistence` forecast result, recommendation result, runtime identifiers, and timestamp.
* Current records are application-level/non-user-scoped because no existing authenticated user identity was found for this component.
* No raw image bytes, model binaries, credentials, or secrets are stored.
* No Firebase credentials were configured, invented, or committed.

Validated behavior:

* With Firebase unconfigured, `/api/v1/grading-forecast/analyze` still returned valid V2 grading, `naive_persistence` forecast, recommendation, and `saved_to_firebase: false`.
* With a simulated Firebase save failure, analyze still returned valid grading/forecast/recommendation and `saved_to_firebase: false`, `document_id: null`.
* A mocked successful Firebase save returned `saved_to_firebase: true` and a generated document ID.
* A mocked successful save writes metadata/results to `grading_forecast_results`; no raw image bytes are stored by the current component code.
* Firebase initialization failure and document serialization failure safely returned non-persisted status without breaking the analysis result.
* Environment variables checked by code are `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH`, `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, and optional `FIREBASE_RESULTS_COLLECTION`.
* Retrieval is not implemented or required by the inspected component requirements.
* Live Firebase write validation was not performed because credentials are not configured in the environment.

### Security

Never hard-code:

* service account keys
* Firebase secrets
* credentials

into the repository.

# Phase 13 — Manual Cross-Component Integration

**You said you will do this manually later.**

So this phase is intentionally outside the immediate Codex work.

### Objective

Integrate your completed component with the other members' components.

Verify:

```text
Other component
      ↓
Shared backend
      ↓
Your grading/forecasting
      ↓
Recommendation
```

Check:

* API contracts
* DTOs
* endpoint paths
* authentication
* response structures
* database/storage dependencies
* error handling
* naming consistency

### Completion criteria

Your component works with the **actual integrated project**, not only in isolation.

---

# Phase 14 — Manual Flutter End-to-End Validation

Again, you will handle this manually.

### Objective

Validate the complete real-world flow.

```text
Flutter
   ↓
Select/capture image
   ↓
Upload
   ↓
FastAPI
   ↓
V2 Berry Model
   ↓
Forecast
   ↓
Recommendation
   ↓
Response
   ↓
Flutter
```

Test:

* successful analysis
* invalid image
* slow network
* backend unavailable
* retry
* different berry grades
* forecast response
* recommendation response

### Important

Compare:

**Backend response**

against

**Flutter displayed result**

to ensure the UI isn't transforming values incorrectly.

---

# Phase 15 — UI/UX Improvement

Do this **after the backend is stable**.

Otherwise you're polishing a broken pipeline.

### Main screens

#### 1. Input

* camera/gallery
* image preview
* clear image
* analyze button
* validation

#### 2. Processing

Show:

> Analyzing berry quality...

rather than leaving the user wondering whether the application is frozen.

#### 3. Results

Display:

```text
Berry Grade
Grade 2

Price Forecast
Current: Rs. XXXX/kg
Forecast: Rs. XXXX/kg

Trend
Increasing / Decreasing / Stable

Recommendation
WAIT
```

Use the existing project design system rather than unnecessarily redesigning everything.

#### 4. Error state

Provide:

> Analysis failed. Please try again.

instead of a raw exception.

### Completion criteria

A user can understand:

1. What grade was predicted?
2. What price is expected?
3. What should they do?
4. Why was that recommendation given?

# The phases you should give Codex

Since you specifically want to **save tokens/credits**, I would **not give Codex all 10 phases at once**.

Use it incrementally.

### Codex Task 1

**Phase 7 — Audit only**

> Inspect the existing FastAPI and Flutter implementation for the berry grading and price forecasting component. Trace the complete request flow, identify the current berry model-loading path, current forecasting implementation, recommendation logic, Firebase/storage behavior, and relevant configuration. Compare the current implementation against the PP2 research artifacts documented in `docs/research/EXPERIMENT_LOG.md`, `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, and `PP2_LIMITATIONS.md`. Do not modify any files. Do not train models. Do not run the project. Do not modify datasets. Return a concise file-by-file implementation map and identify exactly what must change to make the application use the selected PP2 research artifacts.

That's the **only task I'd run first**.

Then:

### Codex Task 2

Phase 8 — Berry runtime.

### Codex Task 3

Phase 9 — Forecast runtime.

### Codex Task 4

Phase 10 — Recommendation audit/fix.

### Codex Task 5

Phase 11 — Error handling/hardening.

### Codex Task 6

Phase 12 — Firebase, **only if required**.

Then **you manually handle**:

```text
Phase 13 → Cross-component integration
Phase 14 → Flutter E2E
Phase 15 → UI/UX
```

Finally:

```text
Phase 16 → Final validation
```
