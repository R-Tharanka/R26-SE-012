## Dataset Preparation Entries

| Entry ID | Status | Dataset | Script | Output Artifacts | Validation Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DATASET-BERRY-V2-PREP | COMPLETE | berry_v2 | `ml/grading_forecast/berry_grading/preprocessing/prepare_berry_dataset_v2.py` | `berry_grading_labels_v2.csv`, `berry_dataset_v2_summary.json`, `berry_split_v2/`, `berry_split_v2_manifest.csv` | PASSED | 168 physical sample groups.

Missing weeks were documented, not fabricated. |

## Pipeline Preparation Entries

| Entry ID | Status | Scope | Files Updated | Validation Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PIPELINE-BERRY-V2-SAFE | COMPLETE | Berry grading V2 pre-training pipeline | `train_berry_classifier.py`, `evaluate_berry_classifier.py`, `export_berry_model.py`, `predict_berry_grade.py` | PASSED | Added explicit V2 train/val/test and output-path support. Dry-runs resolve to `berry_split_v2` and `models/v2`. No model training performed. |
| PIPELINE-PRICE-V2-SAFE | COMPLETE | Price forecasting V2 pre-execution pipeline | `train_forecast_model.py`, `evaluate_forecast_model.py`, `export_forecast_model.py`, `predict_future_price.py` | PASSED | Added explicit V2 path checks, dry-runs, same-test-timestamp evaluation plan, naive persistence metrics support, and V2 output-path support. No RandomForest training or final test evaluation performed. |

## Integration Validation Entries

| Entry ID | Status | Scope | Evidence | Validation Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| INTEGRATION-PHASE5-BACKEND | COMPLETE | Backend grading forecast API | `docs/research/PP2_INTEGRATION_VALIDATION.md` | PASSED WITH LIMITATIONS | FastAPI started and health, price forecast, grade-only, and analyze endpoints returned HTTP 200. Runtime grading used the legacy/root ONNX artifact. Runtime forecasting returned `demo_baseline`. Firebase storage was not configured and returned `saved_to_firebase: false`. |
| AUDIT-PHASE7-IMPLEMENTATION | COMPLETE | Existing implementation audit for berry grading and price forecasting runtime | `docs/research/Pending Work Plan — Berry Grading & Price Forecasting.md`, `docs/research/PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `docs/research/PP2_EXECUTION_CHECKLIST.md` | PASSED | Audit traced Flutter/API to FastAPI routes, services, model/inference, recommendation, Firebase/storage, response handling, configuration, and fallback behavior. At Phase 7 audit time, berry runtime used the legacy/root ONNX model, while the V2 research ONNX existed separately. Forecast runtime can return `demo_baseline`; V2 RF, Phase 4 RF, and Naive Persistence research evidence remain separate from runtime integration. No application code was changed during Phase 7. |
| INTEGRATION-PHASE8-BERRY-V2-RUNTIME | COMPLETE | Berry V2 backend runtime integration | `backend/app/services/grading_forecast/grading_service.py`, `docs/research/PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `docs/research/PP2_EXECUTION_CHECKLIST.md` | PASSED | Berry grading runtime now loads `BERRY-V2-MNV2` from `ml/grading_forecast/berry_grading/models/v2/berry_mobilenetv2_v2_best.onnx`. Service-level validation used `data/processed/grading_forecast/berry_split_v2/test/grade_1/sample_002/20260508_152537.jpg` and returned `Grade 1` with confidence `0.88`; the explanation identified the V2 model path. Existing API response structure was preserved. Forecasting, recommendation rules, Firebase, Flutter, datasets, training, and model artifacts were not changed. |
| INTEGRATION-PHASE9-FORECAST-RUNTIME | COMPLETE | Price forecasting runtime integration | `backend/app/services/grading_forecast/price_forecast_service.py`, `docs/research/PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `docs/research/PP2_EXECUTION_CHECKLIST.md` | PASSED | Requirement check found short-term forecasting/time-series expectations, but no strict runtime mandate to use a trained RandomForest artifact despite weaker V2 test results. Runtime forecasting now uses `naive_persistence` with `data/processed/grading_forecast/price_v2/national_grade1_average_weekly.csv` and saved V2 naive metrics. Service validation returned current price `1886`, predicted price `1886`, trend `stable`, MAE `16.4094`, RMSE `22.5208`, and deterministic repeat `true`. Missing-file validation returns `forecast_unavailable`, not `demo_baseline`. |
| INTEGRATION-PHASE10-RECOMMENDATION | COMPLETE | Recommendation and decision logic validation | `backend/app/services/grading_forecast/recommendation_service.py`, `backend/app/api/routes/grading_forecast.py`, `docs/research/PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `docs/research/PP2_EXECUTION_CHECKLIST.md` | PASSED | Existing rule-table recommendations were validated without changing business rules. The actual-output chain used `BERRY-V2-MNV2` grading and `naive_persistence` forecasting, producing Grade 1, stable trend, and `SELL_EXPORT`. Representative Grade 1/2/3 upward/downward cases, stable trend, missing optional fields, and invalid schema handling were validated. No application code was modified during Phase 10. |
| INTEGRATION-PHASE11-BACKEND-HARDENING | COMPLETE | Backend reliability and error handling for grading-forecast API | `backend/app/api/routes/grading_forecast.py`, `backend/app/services/grading_forecast/grading_service.py`, `docs/research/PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `docs/research/PP2_EXECUTION_CHECKLIST.md` | PASSED; corrective upload validation passed on 2026-08-30 | Added focused image upload validation and safe service failure handling. Valid V2 grading still identifies `BERRY-V2-MNV2`; valid forecasting still returns `naive_persistence`; analyze still returns grading, forecast, recommendation, and optional storage. Corrective validation fixed a Flutter upload compatibility defect where a valid image could be rejected before byte decoding because the multipart MIME value was unreliable. The backend now accepts valid JPEG/PNG/WEBP bytes even when MIME is missing or `application/octet-stream`; missing/empty/non-image/corrupt/oversized images return safe HTTP errors. Missing V2 model artifacts and invalid V2 class mapping fail explicitly without loading the legacy/root ONNX model. Missing or malformed forecast data returns `forecast_unavailable`, not fabricated prices; API routes that require a forecast return HTTP 503 for unavailable forecasts. Unexpected grading/recommendation failures return safe JSON errors. No datasets, model artifacts, Flutter code, Firebase configuration, recommendation rules, or forecasting method selection were changed. |
| INTEGRATION-PHASE12-FIREBASE-PERSISTENCE | COMPLETE | Firebase persistence implementation | `backend/app/services/grading_forecast/result_storage_service.py`, `backend/app/db/firebase.py`, `docs/guidelines_with_steps.md`, `docs/research/PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `docs/research/PP2_EXECUTION_CHECKLIST.md` | IMPLEMENTATION PASSED; LIVE WRITE NOT VALIDATED | Firebase persistence was implemented for application-level result history. Each persisted analysis uses a generated analysis/document ID and stores component metadata, runtime identifiers, V2 grading result, `naive_persistence` forecast, recommendation, and timestamp in `grading_forecast_results`. Validation confirmed mocked Firebase success returns `saved_to_firebase: true` with a document ID; unconfigured Firebase, initialization failure, write failure, and serialization failure return non-persisted status without breaking valid grading/forecast/recommendation output. No credentials were configured or committed. Retrieval was not required by inspected component requirements. |
| INTEGRATION-PHASE12.5-RUNTIME-DIAGNOSTIC | COMPLETE | Runtime model and forecast diagnostic validation | `ml/grading_forecast/berry_grading/training/train_berry_classifier.py`, `ml/grading_forecast/berry_grading/training/export_berry_model.py`, `backend/app/services/grading_forecast/grading_service.py`, `backend/app/services/grading_forecast/price_forecast_service.py`, `ml/grading_forecast/berry_grading/models/v2/class_names.json`, `ml/grading_forecast/berry_grading/models/v2/onnx_metadata.json`, `data/processed/grading_forecast/price_v2/price_v2_coverage_summary.json` | DIAGNOSTIC COMPLETE; NO CODE CHANGED | Manual app testing raised concerns about berry misclassification and identical price forecasts across grades. A controlled 9-image V2 test diagnostic found direct ONNX and backend service predictions agreed for every image, so no direct ONNX-vs-backend class mapping disagreement was confirmed. The sample was 6/9 correct, with Grade 2 at 0/3; this is diagnostic only and does not replace the saved full-test metrics. A preprocessing mismatch was confirmed for later review: training used direct Keras resize to 224x224, while backend runtime uses RGB letterbox to 224x224. Forecast diagnostics confirmed runtime uses one National Grade 1 average weekly series with `naive_persistence`; latest price 1886.14 is rounded to 1886 and predicted as 1886, so identical forecasts across berry grades are expected under the current single-series design. No application code, Flutter code, models, datasets, preprocessing, class mappings, forecasting logic, recommendation rules, or Firebase code were changed. |
| INTEGRATION-PHASE13-OFFLINE-MOBILE-TFLITE | IMPLEMENTED / BUILD VALIDATION PENDING | Offline Flutter grading-forecast fallback and grade-aware predicted market price display | `ml/grading_forecast/berry_grading/training/export_berry_tflite_model.py`, `mobile/assets/models/berry_mobilenetv2_v2_best.tflite`, `mobile/assets/data/`, `mobile/lib/features/grading_forecast/services/offline_grading_forecast_service.dart`, `mobile/lib/features/grading_forecast/services/grading_forecast_analysis_service.dart`, `mobile/lib/features/grading_forecast/screens/price_forecast_screen.dart`, `backend/app/services/grading_forecast/price_forecast_service.py` | TFLite export metadata checked; backend focused tests passed; Flutter validation pending | Existing selected V2 Keras model was converted to TFLite for on-device grading. Flutter analysis now defaults to offline mode and can use API mode with `PEPPER_ANALYSIS_MODE=api`. The price page now shows one `Predicted market price` for the model-predicted grade and removes manual grade selection. Grade 1 uses the National Grade 1 weekly naive-persistence value; Grade 2 subtracts a rounded 100 LKR/kg discount derived from the latest observed National average Grade 1 vs Grade 2 gap; Grade 3 price is unavailable because no reliable Grade 3 historical price series exists. Offline storage returns `saved_to_firebase: false`. No model training, dataset modification, or new evaluation metrics were produced. Local Flutter formatter/analyzer/build validation did not complete because the toolchain timed out. |

## Documentation Finalization Entries

## Required Metric Fields

Berry grading:

- accuracy
- precision per class
- recall per class
- F1 per class
- macro F1
- weighted F1
- confusion matrix
- inference latency if measured

Price forecasting:

- MAE
- RMSE
- MAPE
- R2
- actual vs predicted plot
- residual plot if available
- feature importance if RandomForest is used

## Model Selection Rules

Berry:

- Do not select a model using validation performance only.
- Use the untouched test split for final PP2 metric reporting.
- Inspect Grade 2 recall and confusion with Grade 3.
- Prefer the model with reliable generalization, not only highest apparent accuracy.

Forecasting:

- The RandomForest model must beat or reasonably justify itself against naive persistence.
- If RandomForest does not beat naive, report that honestly and keep the best method as the PP2 baseline.
- Use MAE/RMSE/MAPE as the main practical metrics; R2 may be unstable in short or low-variance test windows.

- `ml/grading_forecast/berry_grading/evaluation/_outputs/v2/confusion_matrix.png`
- `ml/grading_forecast/berry_grading/evaluation/_outputs/v2/training_curves.png`

Observation:

V2 Grade 2 recall improved compared with the historical V1 metric, but V1 and V2 are not directly equivalent experiments because V2 uses the expanded dataset and leakage-safe sample-level split.

Decision:

Use `BERRY-V2-MNV2` as the PP2 berry grading baseline.

Limitations:

- Small dataset: 168 physical sample groups and 671 images.
- Camera-based visual grading only; no chemical or official SLS certification measurements.
- Native Windows TensorFlow used CPU only in the observed training environment.
- Initial write attempts for training/evaluation/export hit permission errors and were rerun with permission escalation using the same commands and methodology.

Final test metrics:

| Method | MAE | RMSE | MAPE | R2 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Naive Persistence | 16.4094 | 22.5208 | 0.8539 | 0.9045 |

- `ml/grading_forecast/price_forecasting/evaluation/_outputs/v2/residuals.png`

Observation:

Naive Persistence clearly outperformed RandomForest on the 36-row V2 test period. The RandomForest model had strong training metrics but poor test generalization, suggesting overfitting and/or a test period where simple persistence is stronger.

Decision:

Use Naive Persistence as the stronger Phase 3 forecasting baseline for PP2. Keep RandomForest as the required ML baseline result and report honestly that it did not outperform the naive baseline.

Limitations:

- Primary target is Grade 1 only.
- Grade 2 coverage is sparse and remains out of scope for Phase 3.
- Missing calendar weeks exist, including a historical 316-day gap.
- Lags and rolling windows mean previous available observations, not exact calendar weeks.
- Test period is short: 36 prediction timestamps.
- No hyperparameter search or advanced time-series model was performed.
- Initial write attempts for training/evaluation/export hit permission errors and were rerun with permission escalation using the same commands and methodology.

### BERRY-V2-IMPROVE-1

Date: 2026-08-27.

Dataset version: `berry_v2`.

Split version: `data/processed/grading_forecast/berry_split_v2_manifest.csv`.

Objective:

Test one limited berry grading improvement by changing only dropout from the Phase 2 baseline value of 0.25 to 0.35.

Configuration:

- Model: MobileNetV2 transfer learning.
- ImageNet initialization: true.
- Input: 224x224 RGB.
- Batch size: 16.
- Seed: 42.
- Stage 1 maximum epochs: 15, learning rate 0.001.
- Stage 2 maximum epochs: 5, learning rate 0.00001.
- Fine-tuned MobileNetV2 layers: final 20 layers.
- Selected improvement variable: dropout 0.35.
- Same V2 train/validation/test split as Phase 2.

- `ml/grading_forecast/berry_grading/evaluation/_outputs/v2_phase4/confusion_matrix.png`

Observation:

The dropout 0.35 model produced the same saved headline test metrics and confusion matrix as the Phase 2 V2 baseline. The Phase 4 model file has a different SHA256 hash from the Phase 2 model, so it is a separate artifact, but it did not produce measurable test-metric improvement.

Decision:

Record the dropout experiment as a valid limited Phase 4 result, but keep `BERRY-V2-MNV2` as the selected PP2 berry grading baseline.

Limitations:

- Only one berry improvement was tested.
- No hyperparameter search was performed.
- `training_history.json` was not present in the Phase 4 berry artifact directory during finalization, so exact completed epoch counts are unavailable from saved artifacts.

Final test metrics:

| Method | MAE | RMSE | MAPE | R2 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Naive Persistence | 16.4094 | 22.5208 | 0.8539 | 0.9045 |
| Phase 3 RandomForest | 82.4179 | 88.4452 | 4.1679 | -0.4736 |
| Phase 4 Extended-Lag RandomForest | 78.1641 | 84.8622 | 3.9482 | -0.3566 |

- `ml/grading_forecast/price_forecasting/evaluation/_outputs/v2_phase4/residuals.png`

Observation:

The extended-lag RandomForest improved over the Phase 3 RandomForest baseline on MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and R2. However, Naive Persistence remained much stronger on the same 36 test timestamps.

Decision:

Record the extended-lag result as a valid limited RF improvement, but keep Naive Persistence as the strongest PP2 forecasting method for the current V2 test period.

Limitations:

- Only one forecasting improvement was tested.
- Missing calendar weeks remain; lags represent previous available observations.
- Test period contains only 36 prediction timestamps.
- Grade 2 forecasting remains out of scope.

## Phase 0 V3 Research Definition Decision

### V3-PHASE0-RESEARCH-DEFINITION

Date: 2026-10-06.

Phase: 0 — Research-definition lock; documentation decision, not a model experiment.

Dataset version: `berry_v3` source/export review.

Research decision:

- The V3 unit of prediction is the harvested pepper sample/batch represented in a smartphone image, not an individual berry.
- The intended task is YOLO-based sample/batch detection/localization followed by sample/batch-level classification as V3 Grade 1 or V3 Grade 2.
- The system must reject non-pepper/invalid inputs, inadequate-quality images, and insufficient-confidence detections or grades instead of always forcing a grade.
- Confidence and quality thresholds will be selected later using validation data; no Phase 0 thresholds were invented.
- Final V3 evaluation must use physical-sample/group-aware splits and a sealed held-out test set. The current Roboflow image-level split is not accepted as the final research split because 146 of 194 physical sample groups cross split boundaries.
- V1 and V2 remain unchanged historical baselines. V3 will use separate versioned artifacts.

Verified taxonomy mapping:

```text
Original/source Grade 1 + Original/source Grade 2 -> V3 Grade 1
Original/source Grade 3                           -> V3 Grade 2
```

Open decisions:

- The repository does not establish scientific equivalence between this custom two-class collapse and SLS grades. The included SLS standard defines three whole-pepper grades.
- The original folder-label provenance and expert/measurement validation are not recorded.
- The Department of Export Agriculture price data uses Grade 1/2 names, but its definitions are not stored, so compatibility with V3 image classes is unproven.
- V3 contains only positive pepper images with one box each; a later approved negative/invalid-input protocol is required to train/calibrate/evaluate rejection.

Decision record: `docs/research/V3_DECISION_RECORD.md`.

Gate result: `BLOCKED — RESEARCHER DECISION REQUIRED` before Phase 1/model development.

## Phase 1 V3 Audit and Grading Diagnosis

### V3-PHASE1-AUDIT

Date: 2026-10-06.

Phase: 1 - dataset audit and grading diagnosis; no model training.

Dataset version: `berry_v3`.

Physical-sample grouping source:

- `D:/work/Year - 4/pepper/project/datset reorder/`
- This pre-Roboflow source was used only for image-to-physical-sample identity.
- Roboflow V3 remains the source of YOLO bounding-box annotations and V3 class labels.

Source and exact-hash mapping result:

- Source structure: `grade_1` = 112 physical samples/448 images; `grade_2` = 82 physical samples/327 images.
- Total: 194 physical samples and 775 images.
- SHA-256 exact V3-to-source matches: 775/775.
- Unmatched: 0.
- Ambiguous matches: 0.
- Duplicate source-hash groups: 0.
- Class consistency: all 448 source `grade_1` images map to V3 Grade 1 and all 327 source `grade_2` images map to V3 Grade 2.

Group-aware split, seed 42:

- TRAIN: 135 groups, 539 images; V3 Grade 1 = 312 images, V3 Grade 2 = 227 images.
- VALIDATION: 29 groups, 116 images; V3 Grade 1 = 68 images, V3 Grade 2 = 48 images.
- TEST: 30 groups, 120 images; V3 Grade 1 = 68 images, V3 Grade 2 = 52 images.
- Pairwise physical-sample intersections are empty.
- The partition union contains all 194 groups and every V3 image appears exactly once.

Blind-review status:

- A validation-only blind package was prepared with 20 V3 Grade 1 and 20 V3 Grade 2 images, neutral IDs, seed 42, and a separate concealed key.
- Status: complete; all 40 responses were valid and the key was opened only after completion.
- Overall agreement: 32/40 = 80.0%.
- V3 Grade 1 agreement: 18/20 = 90.0%.
- V3 Grade 2 agreement: 14/20 = 70.0%.
- Uncertain: 4/40 = 10.0%, with two from each V3 grade.
- Agreement among 36 non-uncertain responses: 32/36 = 88.9%.
- Confusion matrix, rows = true V3 Grade 1/Grade 2 and columns = researcher Grade 1/Grade 2/Uncertain: `[[18, 0, 2], [4, 14, 2]]`.
- Cohen's kappa across all 40 responses, treating Uncertain as a third response category: 0.636.
- Supplementary accepted-only binary kappa across 36 non-uncertain responses: 0.778.
- All four incorrect decisive responses were V3 Grade 2 labeled Grade 1 and came from two physical samples, with two views from each sample.

Shortcut audit result:

- Risk: **HIGH**.
- All images are 4:3 and mean brightness is similar by class.
- Device/resolution is strongly class-correlated: Galaxy A06 appears in 144/448 V3 Grade 1 images but only 1/327 V3 Grade 2 images; 4080x3060 or 8160x6120 occurs in 144 Grade 1 images but only one Grade 2 image.
- Background contact-sheet inspection found hands, pale paper/surfaces, and grey/metal-like surfaces in both classes; it did not prove an exclusive background rule.

V2 saliency result:

- Existing frozen V2 MobileNetV2 only; no retraining or model change.
- 109 historical test images were screened to select nine deterministic examples: three correct and six incorrect, covering all three historical classes.
- Input-gradient saliency classifications: three PEPPER-FOCUSED, six MIXED, zero BACKGROUND-FOCUSED, zero UNCLEAR.
- Hands and surrounding surfaces contributed visibly in multiple examples. Saliency is diagnostic and does not prove causal reasoning.

Final Phase 1 verdict:

```text
LABEL QUALITY: acceptable
SHORTCUT RISK: high
SPLIT: leakage-free
TASK: feasible
```

Unresolved issues:

- The high camera/resolution shortcut risk must be mitigated and evaluated if the task proceeds.
- Dataset label agreement still does not establish equivalence to official SLS, buyer, or price-data grades.
- The blind review is a small single-researcher diagnostic and not definitive statistical or external validation.
- V3 Grade 2 had lower human agreement than V3 Grade 1 and requires explicit per-class monitoring.

Artifacts:

- `docs/research/V3_PHASE1_AUDIT.md`
- `data/processed/grading_forecast/berry_v3/v3_image_sample_manifest.csv`
- `data/processed/grading_forecast/berry_v3/v3_group_split_manifest.csv`
- `data/processed/grading_forecast/berry_v3/v3_phase1_audit_summary.json`

- `ml/grading_forecast/berry_grading/preprocessing/audit_berry_v3_phase1.py`
- `ml/grading_forecast/berry_grading/evaluation/diagnose_v2_saliency.py`

Gate result: `PHASE 1 COMPLETE`. The task is feasible for a separately authorized Phase 2, subject to the documented shortcut and semantic limitations. No Phase 2 work was started.

## Phase 2 V3 YOLO-Based Sample Detection and Grade Classification

### BERRY-V3-YOLO11N-001

Date: 2026-10-07.

Objective: train and evaluate one lightweight YOLO-based harvested pepper sample/batch detector and two-grade classifier using the leakage-free physical-sample split. This was not per-berry detection or grading.

Dataset and split:

- Dataset version: `berry_v3`; 775 images, 194 physical samples, one sample-level YOLO box per image.
- TRAIN: 135 groups/539 images; V3 Grade 1 = 312, V3 Grade 2 = 227.
- VALIDATION: 29 groups/116 images; V3 Grade 1 = 68, V3 Grade 2 = 48.
- TEST: 30 groups/120 images; V3 Grade 1 = 68, V3 Grade 2 = 52.
- Pairwise sample-ID intersections were empty; all 775 images appeared exactly once.
- The Roboflow split was not used as the experimental split. The original source hierarchy remained grouping/reference metadata only.

Dataset preparation and preservation:

- Generated a manifest-driven Ultralytics configuration and minimum materialized working layer from the canonical Roboflow V3 images/labels.
- Ultralytics was observed repairing JPEG end markers during its first scan. The scan was stopped before epoch training; every affected canonical image was restored by exact source mapping and all 775 canonical SHA-256 values were reverified.
- Final training/evaluation used derived, ignored working copies so framework repairs could not touch canonical data.
- Final post-evaluation canonical audit: 775/775 SHA-256 matches; zero mismatches.

Model and environment:

- Framework: Ultralytics 8.4.174; PyTorch 2.14.1+cu130.
- Model: YOLO11n detection, transfer learning from `yolo11n.pt`.
- Image size 640; batch 4; AdamW; initial LR 0.001; weight decay 0.0005; seed 42; deterministic mode; NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2050 4 GB.
- Maximum 75 epochs; patience 12; early stopped after 57 epochs. Best checkpoint: epoch 45.
- Training wrapper wall time: 4,829.93 seconds (80 minutes 29.93 seconds); Ultralytics training time: 1.295 hours.
- Best checkpoint: `ml/grading_forecast/berry_grading/models/v3_yolo/best.pt`.

Threshold decision:

- Baseline threshold: 0.25.
- Validation-only scan: 0.05-0.90 by 0.01, maximizing macro F1 with rejected valid inputs counted as errors; predeclared tie break = lowest threshold.
- Selected/frozen before test: 0.05.
- Selected 0.05 and baseline 0.25 both produced validation macro F1 0.9562, 100% coverage, and zero rejections. This is not a universal threshold and the positive-only data cannot validate non-pepper rejection.

Validation result:

- Detection: precision 0.9479; recall 0.9682; mAP@0.5 0.9879; mAP@0.5:0.95 0.8617.
- Grade: accuracy 0.9569; balanced accuracy 0.9632; macro F1 0.9562; weighted F1 0.9571.
- Grade 1 precision/recall/F1: 1.0000/0.9265/0.9618.
- Grade 2 precision/recall/F1: 0.9057/1.0000/0.9505.
- Confusion matrix, true rows Grade 1/2 and predicted columns Grade 1/2/REJECT: `[[63, 5, 0], [0, 48, 0]]`.

Single sealed TEST result; no post-test tuning or retraining:

- Primary grade metrics: macro F1 0.9578; Grade 1 F1 0.9624; Grade 2 F1 0.9533; balanced accuracy 0.9610.
- Secondary grade metrics: accuracy 0.9583 (115/120); weighted F1 0.9584; Grade 1 precision/recall 0.9846/0.9412; Grade 2 precision/recall 0.9273/0.9808.
- Confusion matrix, true rows Grade 1/2 and predicted columns Grade 1/2/REJECT: `[[64, 4, 0], [1, 51, 0]]`.
- Detection: precision 0.9402; recall 0.9552; mAP@0.5 0.9791; mAP@0.5:0.95 0.8505.
- Coverage 1.0000; zero rejections among the 120 positive pepper images.

Physical-sample result:

- Majority vote: 30/30 correct; accuracy and macro F1 1.0000.
- Confidence-weighted aggregation: 30/30 correct; accuracy and macro F1 1.0000.
- 26 samples unanimous; four samples had conflicting view predictions, all resolved correctly by aggregation.

Operational result:

- Checkpoint size: 5,461,466 bytes (5.21 MiB); 2,590,230 loaded parameters; approximately 6.4 GFLOPs.
- RTX 2050 reported inference: mean/median 7.12 ms/image at batch 4 and 640 input.
- End-to-end 120-image prediction pass: 44.27 seconds, including high-resolution file decode/I/O and batching.

Camera/resolution diagnostic:

- Shortcut risk remains HIGH/unresolved.
- Galaxy A06/4080x3060 test subset: 24 images, all V3 Grade 1, accuracy 1.0000; not class-comparable because Grade 2 support is zero.
- SM-A127F/4000x3000 test subset: 96 images, 44 Grade 1/52 Grade 2; accuracy 0.9479, macro F1 0.9472.
- All five image errors were in the mixed-class SM-A127F subset. Strong performance within that condition is encouraging, but the confounded Galaxy A06 subset prevents a camera-invariance claim.

Error analysis:

- Five incorrect images came from four physical samples. Four Grade 1 images were predicted Grade 2 and one Grade 2 image was predicted Grade 1.
- Representative boxes covered broad pepper sample regions; corrected representative IoUs were approximately 0.906-0.987.
- Box visualizations are diagnostic localization evidence, not proof of causal grade reasoning.

Conclusion:

- Phase 2 demonstrates strong detection and two-grade V3 classification on unseen physical-sample groups, plus promising multi-view consistency and a lightweight checkpoint.
- It does not demonstrate official SLS/buyer-grade recognition, per-berry grading, non-pepper rejection accuracy, camera-independent reasoning, field robustness, mobile latency, or price correctness.
- Status: `PHASE 2 COMPLETE`.
- Phase 3 readiness: yes for a separately authorized negative/invalid-input rejection and calibration study, with the high camera shortcut risk explicitly retained.

Artifacts:

- `docs/research/V3_PHASE2_YOLO_RESULTS.md`
- `data/processed/grading_forecast/berry_v3/yolo_phase2/`
- `ml/grading_forecast/requirements-yolo.txt`

Gate result: `PHASE 2 COMPLETE`. Stop for researcher review; Phase 3 was not started.

## Phase 3 Non-Pepper Rejection, Image-Quality Gating, and Uncertainty Calibration

### BERRY-V3-YOLO11N-PHASE3-001

Date: 2026-10-07.

Objective: evaluate the frozen Phase 2 YOLO11n checkpoint on external non-pepper inputs and add validation-calibrated quality and uncertainty rejection logic. No training, V3 modification, application integration, or sealed-test reuse was permitted.

Preservation and data discipline:

- Frozen checkpoint: `ml/grading_forecast/berry_grading/models/v3_yolo/best.pt`.
- Checkpoint SHA-256 before/after: `c35cc40515adcb6130a4bc93e8ad3de161dcf46b263a9d7df8286a5b4239a9c4`; unchanged.
- Phase 2 sealed TEST accessed: no.
- Calibration positives: the 116-image V3 VALIDATION partition only.
- External negatives: 80 Wikimedia Commons thumbnails across 10 retrieval strata; deterministic seed-42 split into 40 CALIBRATION and 40 held-out EVALUATION images.
- External manifest: 80 unique hashes, zero V3 hash overlap, and complete source-page/license metadata. Contact-sheet audit confirmed 80/80 were non-pepper.

Frozen-model negative baseline over all 80 images:

- Confidence 0.05: 58/80 rejected (72.5%); 22/80 falsely accepted (27.5%).
- Confidence 0.25: 65/80 rejected (81.25%); 15/80 falsely accepted (18.75%).
- At 0.25, false acceptance was concentrated in leaves/plants (6/8) and other crops (4/8).

Validation-only/calibration-negative decisions:

- Detection confidence: 0.55, selected by minimizing calibration-negative false acceptance while retaining at least 95% of validation pepper images. It retained 116/116 and falsely accepted 6/40 calibration negatives.
- Quality rules: Laplacian variance >= 10; brightness >= 50/255; minimum dimension >= 320; detected-box area ratio >= 0.20.
- Controlled quality diagnostic: 12 source validation images produced 36 derived challenges; the respective gates rejected 12/12 blur, 12/12 dark, and 12/12 low-resolution variants, with 0/116 natural validation quality rejections.
- Uncertainty rules: top grade confidence >= 0.05 and class margin >= 0.30. These are abstention heuristics, not calibrated probabilities.

Final consolidated result:

- Valid validation images: 111/116 accepted (95.69% coverage); 5/116 uncertainty rejections (4.31% false-rejection rate); accepted accuracy 108/111 = 97.30%; accepted macro F1 0.9725.
- Accepted grade confusion matrix, true rows Grade 1/2: `[[61, 3], [0, 47]]`.
- Held-out non-pepper images: 35/40 rejected (87.5%); 5/40 falsely accepted (12.5%). Decisions: 33 `NO_PEPPER`, 2 `POOR_IMAGE`, 3 false Grade 1, 2 false Grade 2.
- Consolidated matrix, rows valid pepper/non-pepper and columns Grade 1/Grade 2/Poor Image/No Pepper/Uncertain: `[[61, 50, 0, 0, 5], [3, 2, 2, 33, 0]]`.

Failure pattern and conclusion:

- All five held-out false accepts were leaves/plants or other crops, with confidence 0.589-0.943. The highest-confidence error was a full-image aerial-crop detection at 0.943.
- Raising the threshold enough to eliminate this pattern would violate the predeclared valid-pepper retention constraint.
- Phase 3 evaluation is complete, but operational non-pepper rejection is not solved. A separately authorized controlled hard-negative/open-set experiment is justified; no retraining was performed in this phase.
- Status: `PHASE 3 COMPLETE - OPERATIONAL REJECTION GATE NOT PASSED`.
- Phase 4 readiness: no; researcher authorization/decision is required before any hard-negative retraining or integration.

## Phase 4 Price Data Reconstruction and Market-Aware Forecasting Foundation

### PRICE-EAC-RECONSTRUCTED-V1-001

Date: 2026-10-07.

Objective: replace the incomplete Grade-1/absolute-price foundation with a source-reconstructed, grade-aware EAC farm-gate dataset, next-observation return target, and strict chronological evaluation protocol. No backend/mobile integration, deployment, or later phase was authorized.

Source and reconstruction:

- Authoritative source: DEA Sri Lanka Economic Research Unit, Producers' Prices (Farm Gate) of EAC; index `https://exagri.info/mkt/index.html`.
- Retrieval date 2026-10-07; dataset version `eac_reconstructed_v1`.
- 495 dated index links; 493 successfully parsed pepper pages; broken dated links for 2023-04-25 and 2026-06-23 were retained as missing.
- 16,903 canonical pepper observations from 2016-10-04 through 2026-09-29; zero duplicate canonical keys and zero conflicting duplicates.
- National average series: Grade 1 = 493 observations; Grade 2 = 358; both observed = 358 dates; Grade 2 missing on 135 dates relative to the union.
- No Grade 2 discount, interpolation, resampling, forward fill, or invented observation was used. Raw observations retain exact dated-page provenance.

Existing-data correction:

- Old local range was 2021-02-22 through 2026-08-18 despite its 2016–2026 filename; National averages were Grade 1 = 232 and Grade 2 = 161.
- Five later source dates per grade were isolated: 2026-08-25 through 2026-09-29.
- Historical V2 absolute-price Random Forest and runtime persistence/Grade 2 adjustment artifacts were preserved unchanged.

Target and features:

- Primary target: next-observation percentage return; derived price = dated reference price × (1 + predicted return).
- Horizon: next actual EAC observation; irregular intervals retained.
- Direction: source-exact UP/DOWN/FLAT; predicted FLAT only after equality at the published 0.01 LKR resolution.
- Features: reference price, two price lags, current/prior return, backward three-observation mean and return volatility, and days since prior observation; shared models also used a grade indicator.

Temporal protocol:

- Expanding walk-forward evaluation; a historical row entered training only once its next-observation outcome was known.
- TRAIN targets: 2016-10-11 to 2023-09-19, Grade 1/2 rows 340/213.
- VALIDATION targets: 2023-09-26 to 2025-02-25, rows 73/66.
- FINAL TEST targets: 2025-03-04 to 2026-08-18, rows 74/73.
- EXTERNAL NEWEST targets: 2026-08-25 to 2026-09-29, rows 5/5; excluded from model selection.

Baselines and models actually evaluated:

- Baselines: zero-return persistence, last observed return, expanding grade-specific mean return.
- Models: separate and shared Ridge (`alpha=1.0`); separate and shared Random Forest (100 trees, max depth 5, minimum leaf size 5). Shared variants used a grade indicator.
- Selection score: validation macro-average per-grade return RMSE. Separate Ridge was the best ML candidate at 0.04434, but persistence was better at 0.04319. No tested ML candidate established validation superiority.

Frozen final temporal test, separate Ridge versus persistence:

- Ridge return MAE/RMSE/R²: 0.01989/0.02954/0.1398; persistence: 0.01858/0.03187/-0.0010.
- Ridge directional accuracy: 46.26% overall and 51.52% for non-flat UP/DOWN observations; persistence: 10.20%/0.00% because it always predicts FLAT.
- Ridge derived-price MAE/RMSE: 37.29/54.55 LKR/kg; persistence: 34.62/58.12 LKR/kg.
- Return MAPE was omitted because returns contain and approach zero.
- Result is mixed: Ridge improved RMSE/direction but worsened MAE. It is not established as a superior final forecaster.

Newest temporal reality check:

- Ten observations (five per grade) were evaluated after all selection decisions.
- Ridge return MAE/RMSE: 0.02714/0.03557; direction accuracy 30%; derived-price MAE/RMSE 50.19/64.68 LKR/kg.
- Persistence return MAE/RMSE: 0.02305/0.03259; derived-price MAE/RMSE 42.33/58.22 LKR/kg.
- The best Phase 4 ML candidate did not beat persistence on the genuinely newer observations.

Integrity and conclusion:

- Focused integrity validation passed: source/canonical identity, no duplicates/fabrication, chronological targets, backward lags, no random split, and no test/external selection contamination.
- The reconstructed data foundation and evaluation protocol are ready for a separately authorized Phase 5 experiment, but Phase 4 does not support deployment of the Ridge candidate or a claim of ML superiority.
- Latest verified source, Grade 1, and Grade 2 dates are all 2026-09-29. This is a dated EAC reference, not a real-time buyer quote.
- Status: `PHASE 4 COMPLETE — DATA FOUNDATION READY; FORECASTING IMPROVEMENT NOT YET DEMONSTRATED`.

## Phase 5 Price Movement Forecasting Research

### PRICE-EAC-PHASE5-001

Date: 2026-10-07.

Objective: determine whether short-term Grade 1 and Grade 2 movement can be forecast more usefully than persistence using the frozen `eac_reconstructed_v1` foundation. No Phase 4 overwrite, decision engine, backend/mobile integration, berry-grading change, or Phase 6 work was permitted.

Dataset and preservation:

- Canonical input: 493 National Grade 1 and 358 National Grade 2 averages, 2016-10-04 through 2026-09-29.
- Phase 4 canonical SHA-256 remained `ea800ea576817f07ad54d50317dbd68254fc5dc824447380e58688b6b711c0f6`.
- No interpolation, resampling, forward filling, or fabricated Grade 2 observation.
- Phase 4 reports/data, V2 artifacts, all 775 V3 images/annotations, berry pipeline, backend, and mobile remained unchanged.

Targets and horizon:

- Compared next-observation simple return, log return, and absolute price delta.
- Validation selected next-observation log return.
- Fixed calendar horizons were not evaluated because the source is irregular and no resampling/imputation was authorized.

Features and ablation:

- Tested recent return lags; technical/rolling features; calendar features; and a common-cohort grade-relationship experiment.
- Selected feature group: four completed-return lags plus days since previous observation.
- Macro-grade validation RMSE: return lags 0.04188; technical 0.04633; technical/calendar 0.04645.
- On the same 131-row relationship-eligible cohort, return lags scored 0.04182 versus 0.06090 after adding spread/ratio/other-grade return.

Methods:

- Baselines: persistence, last return, expanding mean return, and explicitly defined historical price drift.
- Statistical: SES alpha 0.2/0.5; ARIMA(1,0,0) and ARIMA(2,0,0) as conditional OLS autoregressions.
- ML: Ridge, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting; separate and shared-grade formulations.
- Selected ML candidate: separate Grade 1/Grade 2 Ridge, log-return target, smallest return-lag feature group.
- Minimum history 50; seed 42; expanding walk-forward; per-window scaler fitting; no random split.

Final temporal test, 147 forecasts through 2026-08-18:

- Selected Ridge return MAE/RMSE/R²: 0.01820/0.02985/0.1215.
- Selected Ridge direction accuracy: 52.38%; non-flat accuracy: 58.33%.
- Selected Ridge price MAE/RMSE/MAPE: 34.00 LKR/kg / 54.73 LKR/kg / 1.815%.
- Persistence return MAE/RMSE: 0.01858/0.03187; price MAE/RMSE: 34.62/58.12 LKR/kg; direction accuracy 10.20% under deterministic FLAT prediction.
- Grade 1 price MAE/RMSE: 15.19/20.84 LKR/kg; Grade 2: 53.06/74.77 LKR/kg.

External later-observation reality check, ten forecasts:

- Selected Ridge return MAE/RMSE: 0.02330/0.03259; price MAE/RMSE: 42.83/58.54 LKR/kg; direction accuracy 70%.
- Persistence return MAE/RMSE: 0.02305/0.03259; price MAE/RMSE: 42.33/58.22 LKR/kg; direction accuracy 10%.
- Ridge correctly predicted four of five later Grade 1 directions, improving the Phase 4 directional failure, but remained fractionally worse than persistence on external price/return error.

Prediction intervals:

- Grade-specific 90th-percentile absolute validation-return residual intervals were frozen before final evaluation.
- Final coverage 96.60%, mean width 275.18 LKR/kg.
- Grade 2 mean width was 456.56 LKR/kg, too broad for strong production confidence claims.

Decision and limitations:

- Persistence comparison: `MIXED` — selected Ridge won validation and final test but not the small external check.
- Main conclusion: recent return lags contain limited predictive information, especially for direction, but consistent ML superiority is not established.
- Grade 2 magnitude error, exact-FLAT failure, absent exogenous variables, irregular frequency, and the ten-observation external sample remain important limitations.
- Phase 6 readiness: `READY WITH LIMITATIONS` for controlled combination research only, not production deployment.
- Complete prediction CSV reproduced byte-for-byte under deterministic configuration.
