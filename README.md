## ✅ Berry Grading & Export Price Forecasting (IT22079268)

This component focuses on berry quality grading, export price forecasting, and decision support. It is based on the responsibilities defined in the project proposal and implemented across the backend, ML pipeline, and mobile app.

### Key Implementation Areas

- backend/app/api/routes/grading_forecast.py (API endpoints)
- backend/app/services/grading_forecast/ (grading, forecasting, recommendations, Firebase storage)
- ml/grading_forecast/ (training, evaluation, inference, and model artifacts)
- data/raw/market_prices and data/raw/berry_images (source datasets)
- data/processed/grading_forecast (cleaned data, splits, and summaries)
- mobile/lib/features/grading_forecast/ (UI screens + API client)

### Progress Checklist (WBS Tasks)

- [x] T1 Dataset collection (berry images + market prices)
- [x] T2 Dataset cleaning and preparation
- [x] T3 Image preprocessing (OpenCV-based)
